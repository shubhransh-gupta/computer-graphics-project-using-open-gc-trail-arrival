Train arrival and departure is a newly designed computer graphics mini project. In this mini project, there will be objects like train, signal, and a place called “railway station”. There will be a train in which it will start arriving at the railway station when the signal light “green” is turned on.

It will stop at the railway station when the red light is turned on and the train will not move from the railway station till the user displays the green light in the traffic signal when the green light is turned on then the train will start to depart from the railway station. In this project, there will be night mode and day mode. This is an overview of the project.

The train arrival and departure is a brand new computer graphics mini project developed using the OpenGL language. The project is a bit difficult to implement since there are lots of objects in this project a train, railway station, signal light these are the main objects and some more in the project.

So let us go through the project there will be train when the user displays the green signal on the traffic signal the train will start arriving at the station. when the train approaches the station then the red signal will be displayed then the train will stop at the railway station and then after displaying the green light, the train will depart from the station.
